The C cookbook
==============

by Dhaivat Pandya
-----------------

C is a pretty awesome language.


Its minimalistic and powerful. 
You can write C on everything.
Blazing fast.

But, its not a language for the faint of heart.
Writing good C code requires experience with the language, or maintaining and debugging applications becomes a nightmare.

This book will help you attain that level of familiarity fairly quickly; and, you can use it as a reference when you get stuck.

So, what are you waiting for?
